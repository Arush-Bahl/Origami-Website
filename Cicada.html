    <h3>
        Facts about cicadas
    </h3>
    <h4>
        1. Cicadas very in size from 0.75 to 2.25 inches long.
    </h4>
    <h4>
        2. Their wings are transparent and can seem rainbow-hued when held up to a light source.
    </h4>
    <h4>
        3. Cicadas are found throughout the U.S. (and many parts of the world), but periodical cicadas — the species that emerge above ground only every few years — live primarily in the eastern and central U.S.
    </h4>
    <h4>
        4. Cicadas can live a relatively long time: 4 to 17 years, depending on whether they are annual or periodical cicadas. The periodical cicadas live the longest.
    </h4>
    <h4>
        5. They spend most of their lives underground as larvae, followed by a short adulthood — from two to six weeks — above ground.
    </h4>  
    <h4>
        6. There are generally two types of cicadas. Annual cicadas emerge every year in late June or August, while periodical cicadas emerge in cycles of 13 or 17 years, depending on the species.
    </h4> 
    <h4>
        7. Cicadas are herbivores. This means they eat vegetation. Young cicadas eat liquid from plant roots, while molting cicadas eat twigs. Adult cicadas do not feed.
